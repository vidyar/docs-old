Continuous deployment to Heroku
================================

Heroku supports Ruby, Node.js, Python, so you can use these languages to build and deploy apps on Heroku. You can deploy to your own server by adding the custom after_success: .

For this you need to add the Public key that was generated for your subscription in shippable to set up continous deployment on providers.

* Go to settings and copy the SSH Key or public key generated for your subscription.

* Log In to Heroku and add the SSH key to your account
