This section helps you to create a shippable.yml file for your Java project.

We support for Ant, Maven, Gradle 1.4, OpenJDK 6, OpenJDK 7 and Oracle JDK 7. A sample shippable .yml file for Java is given below for multiple JDK's test:

.. code-block:: bash

	language: java
 	jdk:
   	   - oraclejdk7
	   - openjdk6

And testing with Open JDK 7 and Oracle JDK 7 

.. code-block:: bash

	jdk:
  	  - openjdk7
  	  - oraclejdk7


**Maven projects**
Test command : If your project has pom.xml file in the repository root ,then Our Java builder will use Maven 3 to build it. By default it will use mvn test to run the test suite.

Dependency Management : Before running tests, Java builder will execute the below line to install your project's dependencies with Maven.

**Ant Projects**

Test command :If your file does not contain gradle or maven files ,then Our Java builder will use Ant to build it. By default it will use Ant test to run the test suite.
